# Image Recognition
My try to make a set of templates for diffrent task in field of image recognition and computer vision using TorchVision package.

## Tasks
1. Binary Classification (CNN from scratch, Sigmoid Activiation, BinaryCrossEntropyLoss)
2. MultiClass Classification (CNN from scratch, ReLu, CrossEntropy)
3. MultiClass Classification (CNN from pretrained models)
4. Object Detection (find object label, position, mask)

## Usage
Read instruction in each folder README file for each task acceptable input data format.
