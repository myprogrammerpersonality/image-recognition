# Image Recognition
Here I tried to make a set of templates for different tasks in image recognition and computer vision using the TorchVision package.

## If your new to Deep Learning
1. [PyTorch-Tutorials](https://github.com/myprogrammerpersonality/image-recognition/tree/main/PyTorch-Tutorial)
## Tasks
1. [Binary Classification](https://github.com/myprogrammerpersonality/image-recognition/tree/main/Binary-CNN) (CNN from scratch, Sigmoid Activation, BinaryCrossEntropyLoss)
2. [MultiClass Classification](https://github.com/myprogrammerpersonality/image-recognition/tree/main/Multi-CNN) (CNN from scratch, ReLu, CrossEntropy)
3. [MultiClass Classification](https://github.com/myprogrammerpersonality/image-recognition/tree/main/Multi-FineTuning-PreTrained) (CNN from pre-trained models)
4. [Object Detection](https://github.com/myprogrammerpersonality/image-recognition/tree/main/Object%20Detection) (find object label, position, mask)

## Usage
Read instruction in each folder's README file for each task's acceptable input data format.
