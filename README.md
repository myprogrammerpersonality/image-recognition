# Image Recognition
Here I tried to make a set of templates for different tasks in image recognition and computer vision using the TorchVision package.

## Tasks
1. Binary Classification (CNN from scratch, Sigmoid Activation, BinaryCrossEntropyLoss)
2. MultiClass Classification (CNN from scratch, ReLu, CrossEntropy)
3. MultiClass Classification (CNN from pre-trained models)
4. Object Detection (find object label, position, mask)

## Usage
Read instruction in each folder README file for each task acceptable input data format.
